# Building-Deep-Neural-Network
First Step towards Deep Net.
In this Notebook we implement all the function required to build a deep Neural Network
Notations are - 1. uperscript[l] denotes a quantity associated with the lth layer.

Example: a[l] is the Lth layer activation.W[l] and b[l] are the Lth layer parameters.

2.Superscript(i) denotes a quantity associated with the ith example.

Example: x[i] is the ith training example

3.Lowerscript i denote the ith entry of a vector
